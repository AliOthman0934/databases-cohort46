1. What columns violate 1NF?
The given table has a violation of the 1NF (First Normal Form) because the food_code and food_description columns are not atomic. They store multiple values separated by commas, which is not a standard practice in relational databases.

2. What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
Based on the data, we can identify the following entities:

Member
Dinner
Venue
Food

3. Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.
To make the solution 3NF compliant, we need to create separate tables for each identified entity and ensure that each table adheres to the Third Normal Form. Here are the tables:

Member Table:

Table Name: Members
Columns: member_id (Primary Key), member_name, member_address
Dinner Table:

Table Name: Dinners
Columns: dinner_id (Primary Key), dinner_date, venue_code (Foreign Key), member_id (Foreign Key)
Venue Table:

Table Name: Venues
Columns: venue_code (Primary Key), venue_description
Food Table:

Table Name: Foods
Columns: food_code (Primary Key), food_description
DinnerFood Table (Associative Table):

Table Name: DinnerFoods
Columns: dinner_id (Foreign Key), food_code (Foreign Key)
